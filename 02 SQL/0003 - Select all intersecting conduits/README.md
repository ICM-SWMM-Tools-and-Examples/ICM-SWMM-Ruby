# Select all intersecting conduits
This SQL demonstrates how to select two link objects, in this case Conduits, that overlap spatially. For this you need to activate the 'Spatial Search' criteria as shown in the image below. In this case the Conduits are queried against each other but this can be done against a Network, Background network or GIS object data.

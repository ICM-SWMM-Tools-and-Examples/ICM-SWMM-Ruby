# Copy object data to a scenario
This SQL demonstrates how object links exist between objects. In this case a link is made between a subcatchment and the node that it drains to. This is taken advantage of by using the 'node.' function. These links can be checked by using the 'Field Type' drop-down menu in the SQL editor.
